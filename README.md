# PersonalDnD
#####(Name Pending)
A personal project for DND Sheets &amp; Die Rolls in C#

##Big Changes
Hey everyone, (I know we don't have many people working on this repo right now but still) so big changes have come to our scope. When the project started we had the idea of it being nothing more than a simple application to store your character info and generate die rolls. Well that's in the past, our plan now is to build a full dnd suite that allows users to also add in maps, have live encounters and introduces user roles such (DM, Player)

####Crossplatform
We are also happy to report that we are now aiming for a cross-platform release for Windows, Linux & possibly Mac OS with the latter being dependent on whether or not we will need a Xamarin License. This of course means that we are migrating from **WPF** to **Eto.Forms**.

This is **IMPORTANT** if you have forked the project because this means a total restructure and basically dropping everything but the data model so beware!
